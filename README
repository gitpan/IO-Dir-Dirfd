NAME
    IO::Dir::Dirfd - Perl extension to extract the file descriptor from a
    dirhandle

SYNOPSIS
      use IO::Dir::Dirfd;

      opendir D, "." or die $!;
      my $fd = dirfd(D);

      use IO::Dir::Dirfd qw(fileno);

      opendir D, "." or die $!;
      my $fd = fileno(D);

DESCRIPTION
    The IO::Dir::Dirfd module provides the possibility to extract the file
    descriptor from a directory handle on platforms where this functionality
    is available.

    It exports a single sub, dirfd(), by default. If you specify that you
    want to export fileno(), the core fileno() will be overrided. After this
    you can use fileno() for both file- and dirhandles.

BUGS
    As of now, the module was only tested on FreeBSD 4.4 and FreeBSD 5.0;
    there's no garantee it will work as advertised elsewehere (or even on
    FreeBSD, for that matter).

    It is possible that the fileno(HANDLE) form will not work under all
    circumstances. Use fileno(*HANDLE) instead if in doubt.
